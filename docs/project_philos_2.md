# PHILOS 2

## Intro:

This is a work in progress Project Design Doc. I'm going to try out a format, see how it works, then iterate on it.

This document is a lot of things, but maybe it's important to define what it is not.

It is not the full description of everything.

It is not the script for the game. The full plot will probably only be visible IN THE GAME! Or maybe I will draw it or something. I don't know yet.

This document is a tracker. It tracks overall progress.

It is also a basic design doc. It holds the vision for the game. Come back to here for each project to make sure that you remember what it is you're making.

## Premise

- Describe the story of the game. What is the game about? What genre is it? How will you talk about it with people?

WAR! It has finally happened. They have come after the Colonies after all these years.

The Colonies were founded thousands of years ago, long before the invention of Gateways. Before the Gateways, which allow for instantaneous travel through the stars, settlers left known space on generations ships. 100 generations of people lived and died in great flotillas, traveling the vast distance to the new worlds they founded. Located in the [Name Needed Philos?] System, 3 habitable worlds were settled by the families when they arrived. Their time in space made them perfect for living off the stars. They mined local fields for ore and resources, and made their planets into gardens, where technology wasn't even allowed. Great stations were made above the planets where any work involving computers or technology was done. Ore was refined in space. Manufacturing was all done on moons and in bases orbiting the planets.

For many generations they lived in peace, believing themselves to be a new civilization completely cut off from their mother land. But they were wrong. The Empire Accord came in the year 35,892. A Gateway opened just outside of the system. Fleets began pouring out of the great whole in space, and they never stopped. The Empire Accord demanded that the people were merely colonies of their vast empire, and wanted their dues paid. They took one of the 3 worlds 50 years later, and burned the garden to the ground.

The war for the remaining 2 worlds continues on...

You are a miner, working in a field of rocks far far away from any kind of combat. You have been to both of the Garden Worlds, but circumstance or desire lead you, like so many others, to the stars where you families lived for so long.

Your job is simple. Keep the drones mining. Find and mark rocks for the drones to mine. Protect the drones from any Pirate or Empire Accord attacks. Protect the base at all costs, and keep the ore flowing.
