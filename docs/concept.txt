# Initial Premise: 

WAR! It has finally happened. They have come after the Colonies after all these years.

The Colonies were founded thousands of years ago, long before the invention of Gateways. Before the Gateways, which allow for instantaneous travel through the stars, settlers left known space on generations ships. 100 generations of people lived and died in great flotillas, traveling the vast distance to the new worlds they founded. Located in the [Name Needed Philos?] System, 3 habitable worlds were settled by the families when they arrived. Their time in space made them perfect for living off the stars. They mined local fields for ore and resources, and made their planets into gardens, where technology wasn't even allowed. Great stations were made above the planets where any work involving computers or technology was done. Ore was refined in space. Manufacturing was all done on moons and in bases orbiting the planets.

For many generations they lived in peace, believing themselves to be a new civilization completely cut off from their mother land. But they were wrong. The Empire Accord came in the year 35,892. A Gateway opened just outside of the system. Fleets began pouring out of the great whole in space, and they never stopped. The Empire Accord demanded that the people were merely colonies of their vast empire, and wanted their dues paid. They took one of the 3 worlds 50 years later, and burned the garden to the ground.

The war for the remaining 2 worlds continues on...

You are a miner, working in a field of rocks far far away from any kind of combat. You have been to both of the Garden Worlds, but circumstance or desire lead you, like so many others, to the stars where you families lived for so long.

Your job is simple. Keep the drones mining. Find and mark rocks for the drones to mine. Protect the drones from any Pirate or Empire Accord attacks. Protect the base at all costs, and keep the ore flowing.

# Empire Accord: 

This is not just a simple kingdom. 

As far as anyone knows, life has only ever been found on the Earth. That is where all human kind originated. Scientists can't explain it. It seems as if the chances of life evolving are much much slimmer than we ever imagined. 

When the generation ships left, they never intended to come back. Part of this was because of the way things were going. As time went on, things were not getting better for anyone. Money and greed took over everything. The government was nothing more than a group of corporations fighting over control of the employees. There was no care or love left on the Earth. They wanted out. They wanted to make a world where money wasn't the only thing that mattered. 

The wheels of progress wont be stopped. As the generations past, and the Gardeners(?) made there slow journey through the stars, industry proceeded. Profits soared. Crashes crippled giants. At long length, an order was established. The Empire Accord won. They were the biggest, meanest corporation to come out of 20,000 years of capitalism. 

And they want their profits...

# The Gardeners:

These are the people who settled the garden worlds. They don't even live on the garden worlds. 

The spend generations on their ships. We are talking about 100 generations of humans who... the only life they knew was the flotilla. This journey changed them as a people. You could argue that they are not even human any longer... 

They are far more adapted to living in stations, or on ships. They feel safer knowing that all the systems of their world can be checked and controlled. It's uncommon to find a Gardener who is truly happier on the ground than in the space. 

They revere the soil and the earth of the planets that they are keeping. Unlike those they left behind, they wish to keep the beauty of the wild nature safe and preserved. They spent so much time in the black that they learned just how hard it is to find something that can be called heaven. 


# Technology: 

Because the Gardeners spent so much time in space, so many generations on ships, they learned how to build ships that are unlike anything the Empire Accord has.

They know how to tune engines, how to re-enforce a hull, or how to handle an environment decompression like Earth born know how to tell what season it is. Gardener ships are fast, maneuverable and tough. 

The Empire Accord has the industry of trillions behind them, and they have been busy. The Department of R&D has spent countless lives developing weapons of great power. When the Gardeners first faced the Accord, they were stunned by the sheer power of their weapons. It felt to them as if they had wasted all of their efforts. The first few battles went overwhelmingly in favor of the Accord. 

Later, after the Burning of the First World, the Gardeners became more clever, more ruthless. They started to learn how to strip weapons from captures enemy ships, and they learned how to adapt to the new technology. Better defenses were created, and the Accord no longer had an edge over the Gardeners. 

# The Arrival

When the Empire Accord first arrived in the system, the Gardeners were completely unprepared. Many stations fell before it become clear what was happening. 

It took so long for their people to make their slow way through the stars to get to these Garden Worlds. They didn't think they would ever seen another human being again. 

The Empire Accord created the Gateways at great cost to them. They had completely forgotten about the generation ships, the flotilla that they sent out there to claim those worlds. 

When they sent their scouts, the reports were almost too good to believe. Of all the worlds that had been found, none showed so much promise as these lush worlds. The raw materials alone would fuel a new wave of invention. After the planet was stripped, it could be turned into a farm that could feed the entire Empire Accord, and they would be the only ones who controlled it! 

The Empire accord insists that they own the rights to the planets. They commissioned the ships, and so they own all the claims. 

The Gardeners didn't sign any such papers. The contract that they had for the ships says that they owned the ships. In returned, many generations were sold into bondage. Many volunteered to stay behind so that others could have a hope at a better world, a better life. This sacrifice was forgotten by the Accord, but not by the Gardeners. 

# Drones

Mining raw ore is as important as always. Even though the Gardeners know the planets they tend are full of resources, they will not mine them. The planet is sacred to them. It is not to be touched. 

Great herds of drones swarm through asteroid fields, searching for ore, ice, and scrap to salvage. So called ranchers or herders live in stations on the border of the fields. They fly a craft through the rocks looking for drones that need repairs, tagging valuables to be harvested, and fending off any pirates that seek to main the drones, or take their hauls. 

# The Game

You are not involved in this war. You wont even see a battle. You are a humble drone rancher. Your sole purpose is to keep the ore flowing to the station. It is used by great battle fleets to create armies of attack drones that are thrown at the great ships of the Empire Accord. The ships of the Gardeners are factories that produce ships during battle, as long as they have the raw ore needed to create the fleets of drones. 

You are just the rancher. You just keep the drones happy.
